{"id":"experiment1-018","title":"Install system Chromium for headless browser automation","description":"Headless browser automation is needed for web scraping, testing, and interactive demos. Currently puppeteer and rodney both fail because the environment lacks system libraries required by Chromium (glib, nss, dbus, atk, etc.). Need to install Chromium via apt or another method that works without root privileges, or find an alternative approach like using a remote browser service.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"noreply@sprites.dev","created_at":"2026-02-20T21:09:16Z","created_by":"Sprite","updated_at":"2026-02-20T21:10:50Z"}

{"id":"experiment1-yrc","title":"Analyze puzzle34 logic for simpler underlying model","description":"## Analysis Complete\n\n### Simple Principle Found\n\nEach lamp lights when its corresponding button is the **MINORITY** among all 4 buttons:\n\n- **Lamp1** ↔ **Button B1**\n- **Lamp2** ↔ **Button B2**  \n- **Lamp3** ↔ **Button A2**\n- **Lamp4** ↔ **Button A1**\n\n### Rule:\n- When exactly **1 button** is pressed → that button's lamp lights\n- When exactly **3 buttons** are pressed → the single unpressed button's lamp lights\n- (When 0, 2, or 4 buttons pressed → all lamps off)\n\n### Formal Formula:\n`lamp(button) = (sum_of_pressed == 1 AND button_pressed) OR (sum_of_pressed == 3 AND button_not_pressed)`\n\nOr equivalently: the lamp lights when the button's state differs from the majority (minority rule).\n\n### Verification:\nThe complex bitwise formula in the JavaScript:\n`lamp1 = \\!A1\u0026\\!A2\u0026B1\u0026\\!B2 | A1\u0026A2\u0026\\!B1\u0026B2`\n\nIs equivalent to the simple minority rule above.\n\n### About 'the bug':\nThe commented-out simpler code showed the original intent where lamp1 and lamp2 had identical formulas (the 'bug'). The actual code intentionally makes each lamp's behavior unique by mapping to different buttons, creating the asymmetric but principled behavior discovered above.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"Sprite","owner":"noreply@sprites.dev","created_at":"2026-02-20T21:09:29Z","created_by":"Sprite","updated_at":"2026-02-20T21:33:00Z","closed_at":"2026-02-20T21:33:00Z","close_reason":"Closed"}
